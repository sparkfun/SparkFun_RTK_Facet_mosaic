The RTK Facet mosaic is a fully enclosed and pre-programmed device. There are very few things to worry about or configure, but we will cover the basics here.

## :material-folder-cog: Design Files
The SparkPNT RTK Facet mosaic L-Band board design is similar to previous generations in our line Facet line of products. However, we have made some modifications to the design to enhance the durability of this product. The PCB design features three separate board components:

- A central board that hosts primary components of the RTK Facet mosaic, such as the ESP32-WROVER-E, mosaic-X5, etc.
- A peripheral board that provides connections to the RTK Facet mosaic
- A display board that is the primary interface for the RTK Facet mosaic

</figcaption>
</figure>

The RTK Facet mosaic has a large, built-in 6000mAh lithium polymer battery that will enable over **25 hours** of field use between charging. If more time is needed a common USB power bank can be attached boosting the field time to any amount needed.

!!! info
	For more information, please refer to the [**Internal Batter** section](./hardware_overview.md/#internal-battery)


#### Charge LED

<figure markdown>
[![RTK Facet mosaic Charge LED](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/8/8/SparkFun_RTK_Facet_-_Front_Face_-_Charge_LED.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/8/8/SparkFun_RTK_Facet_-_Front_Face_-_Charge_LED.jpg)
<figcaption markdown>
Charge LED indicator on the RTK Facet mosaic.
</figcaption>
</figure>

The Charge LED is located on the front face. It will illuminate any time there is an external power source and will turn off when the internal battery is charged. With the unit fully powered down, charging takes approximately **6 hours** from a 1A wall supply or **12 hours** from a standard USB port. The RTK Facet mosaic can run while being charged but it increases the charge time. Using an external USB battery bank to run the device for extended periods or running the device on a permanent wall power source is supported.



### Operation Modes

At *Power On* the device will enter **Rover** or **Base** mode; whichever state the device was in at the last power down. When the ++"POWER/SETUP"++ button is pressed momentarily, a menu is presented to change the RTK Facet mosaic to Rover or Base mode. The display will indicate the change with a small car or flag icon.

!!! info "**Rover** Mode"
	In **Rover** mode the RTK Facet mosaic will receive `L1` and `L2` GNSS signals from the four constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou) and calculate the position based on these signals. Similar to a standard grade GPS receiver, the RTK Facet mosaic will output industry standard NMEA sentences at 4Hz and broadcast them over any paired Bluetooth® device. The end user will need to parse the NMEA sentences using commonly available mobile apps, GIS products, or embedded devices (there are many open source libraries). Unlike standard grade GPS receivers that have **2500mm** accuracy, the accuracy in this mode is approximately **300mm** horizontal positional accuracy.

	- *w/ RTK Fix*

		:	If the device is in **Rover** mode but L-Band is not available, regular RTCM based RTK is still available. When RTCM correction data is sent over Bluetooth® or into the radio port, the device will automatically enter Positioning with RTK mode. In this mode RTK Facet mosaic will receive `L1` and `L2` signals from the antenna; and correction data from a base station. The receiver will quickly (within a second) obtain an RTK float, then fix. The NMEA sentences will have increased accuracy of **14mm** horizontal and **10mm** vertical accuracy.

			1. The RTCM correction data is most easily obtained over the Internet using a free app on your phone (see SW Maps or Lefebure NTRIP) and sent over Bluetooth® to the RTK Facet mosaic.
			2. The RTCM correction data can also be delivered over an external cellular or radio link to a 2nd RTK Facet, Surveyor, Express, etc setup as a base station.

	- *w/ RTK L-Band Fix*

		:	In **Rover** mode the RTK Facet mosaic will check if WiFi is available and update any L-Band keys needed (keys expire every 56 days). The device will automatically begin receiving and decrypting position correction data. Simultaneously, the RTK L-Band will receive `L1` and `L2` GNSS signals from the four constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou). The device will calculate the position based on the combination of GNSS and correction signals. The receiver will quickly (within 60 seconds) obtain an RTK float, then fix. Similar to a standard grade GPS receiver, the RTK Facet mosaic will output industry standard NMEA sentences at 4Hz and broadcast them over any paired Bluetooth® device. The end user will need to parse the NMEA sentences using commonly available mobile apps, GIS products, or embedded devices (there are many open source libraries). Unlike standard grade GPS receivers that have **2500mm** accuracy, the accuracy in this mode is approximately **14 to 60mm** horizontal positional accuracy.

!!! info "**Base** Mode"
	In **Base** mode the device will enter Base Station mode. This is used when the device is mounted to a fixed position (like a tripod or roof). The RTK Facet mosaic will initiate a survey. After 60 to 120 seconds the survey will complete and the RTK Facet mosaic will begin transmitting RTCM correction data out the radio port. A base is often used in conjunction with a second RTK Facet mosaic (or RTK Surveyor, Express, Express Plus, etc) unit set to *Rover* to obtain the **14mm** accuracy. Said differently, the Base sits still and sends correction data to the Rover; so that the Rover can calculate a really accurate position.

Configuring the RTK Facet mosaic can be done over the *USB-Serial CH340* COM port via serial text menu. Various debug messages are printed to this port at **115200bps** and a serial menu can be opened to configure advanced settings. The mosaic-X5 can be configured over the *USB Serial Device* port using [web interface](./software_overview.md/#web-interface). It’s not necessary in normal operation but is handy for tailoring the receiver to specific applications.



### Radio

<figure markdown>
[![RTK Facet mosaic Radio Connector](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/8/8/SparkFun_RTK_Facet_-_Ports_-_Radio.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/8/8/SparkFun_RTK_Facet_-_Ports_-_Radio.jpg)
<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

This port is used when an external cellular or radio link is needed. This port is *not* used if you transfer RTCM from your phone to the RTK Facet mosaic over Bluetooth.

This 4-pin JST connector can be used to allow RTCM correction data to flow into the device when it is acting as a **Rover** or out of the device when it is acting as a **Base**. The connector is a 4-pin locking 1.25mm JST SMD connector (1). The RTK Facet mosaic comes with a cable to interface to this connector, but [additional cables](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17239) can be purchased separately. You will most likely connect one of our [Serial Telemetry Radios](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/19032) to this port, if you don’t have access to a correction source on the internet. The pinout is **3.5-5.5V**/`TX`/`RX`/`GND` from left to right as pictured. **3.5V to 5.5V** is provided by this connector to power a radio with a voltage that depends on the power source. If USB is connected to the RTK Facet mosaic then voltage on this port will be **5V** (+/-10%). If running off of the internal battery then voltage on this port will vary with the battery voltage (**3.5V** to **4.2V** depending on the state of charge). This port is capable of sourcing up to **600mA** and is protected by a PTC (resettable fuse). This port should not be connected to a power source.

	- Mating cable connector
		- **part#:** GHR-04V-S

Internally, the Data connector is connected to a digital mux allowing one of four software selectable setups. See the [Ports Menu](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/menu_ports/) for a description of each option.:

- **NMEA** - The `TX` pin outputs any enabled messages (NMEA and RTCM) at a default of **460800bps** (configurable 9600 to 921600bps). The `RX` pin can receive RTCM messages for an RTK fix.
- **PPS/Trigger** - The `TX` pin outputs the pulse-per-second signal that is accurate to 30ns RMS. The `RX` pin is connected to the `EVENTA` pin on the mosaic-X5, allowing for events to be measured with incredibly accurate nano-second resolution. Useful for things like audio triangulation.
- **I^2^C** - The `TX` pin operates as `SCL`, `RX` pin as `SDA` on the I^2^C bus. This allows additional sensors to be connected to the I2C bus.
- **GPIO** - The `TX` pin operates as a DAC capable `GPIO 21` on the ESP32. The `RX` pin operates as a ADC capable input (`GPIO39`) on the ESP32. This is useful for custom applications.

Most applications do not need to utilize this port and will send the NMEA position data over Bluetooth. This port can be useful for sending position data to an embedded microcontroller or single board computer. The pinout is **3.3V**/`TX`/`RX`/`GND`. **3.3V** from left to right as pictured, which is provided by this connector to power a remote device if needed. While the port is capable of sourcing up to **600mA**, we do not recommend more than **300mA**. This port should not be connected to a power source.

The RTK Facet mosaic has a built in **6000mAh** battery and consumes approximately **240mA** worst case with Bluetooth connection active and GNSS fully tracking. This will allow for around *25 hours* of use in the field. If more time is needed in the field a standard USB power bank can be attached. If a *10,000mAh* bank is attached one can estimate *56 hours* of run time; assuming, 25% of the capacity is lost to efficiencies of the power bank and charge circuit within RTK Facet mosaic.

The RTK Facet mosaic can be charged from any USB port or adapter. The charge circuit is rated for 1000mA, so USB 2.0 ports will charge at **500mA** and USB 3.0+ ports will charge at **1A**.

To quickly view the state of charge, turn on the unit. The battery icon will indicate the following:

- 3 bars: >75% capacity remain
- 2 bars: >50% capacity remain
- 1 bar: >25% capacity remain
- 0 bars: <25% capacity remain
