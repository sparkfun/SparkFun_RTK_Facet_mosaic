However, the survey-in method is not recommended for the highest accuracy measurements because the positional accuracy of the base will directly translate to the accuracy of the rover. Said differently, if your base's calculated position is off by 100cm, so will every reading your rover makes. If you're looking for maximum accuracy consider installing a static base with fixed antenna.

Additionally, housed under the dome of the RTK Facet mosaic L-Band is a surveyor grade L1/L2/L5-Band antenna. This antenna is a unique combination of elements designed to receive the GNSS signals (L1/L2/L5) alongside the 1.55GHz PointPerfect corrections. The RTK Facet mosaic L-Band is programmed in Arduino and can be tailored by you to fit whatever your needs may be.</p> <p>This device can be used in five modes:</p> <ul> <li>GNSS Positioning (~30cm accuracy) - also known as Rover</li> <li>GNSS Positioning with RTK L-Band (1.4 to 6cm accuracy) - also known as Rover with L-Band RTK Fix</li> <li>GNSS Positioning with RTK (1.4cm accuracy) - also known as Rover with RTK Fix</li> <li>GNSS Base Station</li> <li>GNSS Base Station NTRIP Server</li> </ul> <p>At Power On the device will enter Rover or Base mode; whichever state the device was in at the last power down. When the POWER/SETUP button is pressed momentarily, a menu is presented to change the RTK Facet mosaic L-Band from Rover to Base mode or vice-versa. The display will indicate the change with a small car (Rover) or flag (Base) icon.</p> <p>In Rover mode the RTK Facet mosaic L-Band will check if WiFi is available and update any L-Band keys needed (keys expire every 56 days). The device will automatically begin receiving and decrypting position correction data. Simultaneously, the RTK L-Band will receive <code>L1</code>, <code>L2</code>, and <code>L5</code> GNSS signals from the four constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou). The device will calculate the position based on the combination of GNSS and correction signals. The receiver will quickly (within 60 seconds) obtain an RTK float, then fix. Similar to a standard grade GPS receiver, the RTK Facet mosaic L-Band will output industry standard NMEA sentences at 4Hz and broadcast them to any paired Bluetooth\u00ae device. The end user will need to parse the NMEA sentences using commonly available mobile apps, GIS products, or embedded devices (there are many open source libraries). Unlike standard grade GPS receivers that have 2500mm accuracy, the accuracy in this mode is approximately 10 to 60mm horizontal positional accuracy.</p> <p>If the device is in Rover mode but L-Band is not available, regular RTCM based RTK is still available. When RTCM correction data is sent over Bluetooth\u00ae or into the radio port, the device will automatically enter Positioning with RTK mode. In this mode RTK Facet mosaic L-Band will receive <code>L1</code>/<code>L2</code>/<code>L5</code> signals from the antenna and correction data from a base station. The receiver will quickly (within a second) obtain an RTK float, then fix. The NMEA sentences will have increased accuracy of 10mm horizontal and 10mm vertical accuracy. The RTCM correction data is most easily obtained over the Internet using a free app on your phone (see our SW Maps (Android/iOS) or Lefebure NTRIP instructions) and sent over Bluetooth\u00ae to the RTK Facet mosaic L-Band. However, RTCM correction data can also be received over an external cellular or radio link from a 2nd RTK Facet, Surveyor, Express, etc. that is setup as a base station.</p> <p>In Base mode the device will enter Base Station mode. This is used when the device is mounted to a fixed position (like a tripod or roof). The RTK Facet mosaic L-Band will initiate a survey. After 60 to 120 seconds the survey will complete and the RTK Facet mosaic L-Band will begin transmitting RTCM correction data out the radio port. A base is often used in conjunction with a second RTK Facet mosaic L-Band (or RTK Surveyor, Express, Express Plus, etc) unit set to Rover to obtain the 10mm accuracy. Said differently, the Base sits still and sends correction data to the Rover, so that the Rover can output really accurate position data for its location.</p> <p>In addition to supplying position data, the RTK Facet mosaic L-Band is capable of logging NMEA, RAWX, and SFRBX for post processing making it ideal for research and advanced positioning applications.</p> <p>The RTK Facet mosaic L-Band is an open-source hardware product meaning you can fully obtain, see, and even modify the electrical and mechanical design files.

For basic users, it's incredibly easy to get up and running; for advanced users, the RTK Facet mosaic L-Band is a flexible and powerful tool. With just the press of a button, the RTK Facet mosaic L-Band is the fastest way to take centimeter-grade measurements. With a subscription to the PointPerfect service (not included), 10mm Real Time Kinematic fixes are less than a minute away. By connecting your phone to the RTK Facet mosaic L-Band over Bluetooth\u00ae, your phone or tablet can receive the NMEA output and work with most GIS software programs. This is exactly how $10,000 surveying devices have been operating for the past decade - we just made it faster, more precise, and a lot more economical.</p> <p>The RTK Facet mosaic L-Band works with common GIS software for Android and iOS including SW Maps Android / iOS, Field Genius, SurvPC, Survey Master, Vespucci, QGIS, QField, and any GIS software that supports NMEA over Bluetooth.</p> <p>The RTK Facet mosaic L-Band can utilize corrections from u-blox's PointPerfect service broadcast from a geosynchronous Inmarsat satellite. Users only need to setup a subscription service with their product registration and provide a WiFi SSID and password. Once entered, the device will provision itself and periodically (once a month, over WiFi) update the decryption keys necessary to use the PointPerfect service.</p> <p>Subscription Required</p> <p>This service requires an additional monthly subscription fee.
